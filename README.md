MiePy
==============

MiePy is a Python module to calculate scattering and absorption properties of spheres and core-shell structures. Mie theory is used, following the procedure in "Absorption and Scattering of Light by Small Particles" by Bohren & Huffman.

The material can be specified by a frequency dependent permittivity and permeability.


Dependencies
--------------
Required Python modules: numpy, scipy, matplotlib,
                         sympy (for core-shell)

For installation of these, see https://www.scipy.org/install.html
